# Euler-Circuit
Algorithm to find an Euler circuit from a given graph with n vertices.
This was for an assignment in my maths proofs class. Test.java, Walk.java, and every method inside Graph.java was given to us.
The project required filling out the last 3 methods in Graph.java in order to search for the circuit, verify if it exists, and verify if the given input is an Euler circuit.
